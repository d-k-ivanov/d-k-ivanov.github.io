# Bret Victor: The Future of Programming

A visionary talk by Bret Victor about the future of programming, presented at Dropbox DBX in 2013. In this talk, he pretends to be a conference attendee from the year 1973.

I saw this talk many years ago, and now I can find some new insights in it. So, I want to save it here for the future me to rewatch it in a few years to see what else changed in the world of information technology.
