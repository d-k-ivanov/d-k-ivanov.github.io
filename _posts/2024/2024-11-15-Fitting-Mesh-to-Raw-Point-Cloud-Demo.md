<h1> Fitting Deformable Mesh Models to Raw Point Cloud </h1>

I have begun experimenting with artificial intelligence in Computer Graphics, and find even the smallest details captivating. Currently, I'm reading [3D Deep Learning with Python](https://www.packtpub.com/en-es/product/3d-deep-learning-with-python-9781803247823) and definitely can recommend this book as a brief introduction to the initial stage of AI in Computer Graphics.

As the first try, I made a small video which contains a frame for the state of a spherical point cloud that is slowly optimizing towards the sample point cloud (pedestrian.ply)
