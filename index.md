## About Me

I'm a motivated, hardworking, and results-oriented engineer with extensive experience developing cross-platform software. I've spent most of my career in the financial, medical, and gaming industries. Always put the product first.

I enjoy many aspects of computer science and am interested in how systems work. My interests include programming languages, low-level computing, operating systems, computer hardware, parallel computation, simulation, procedural computer graphics, and embedded platforms. I hold a master's degree in computer graphics, which shaped my worldview.

In my spare time, I enjoy reading books, writing programs, going for walks, observing the night sky, and watching scientific videos.
