## About Me

I'm an energetic, hard-working, and result-oriented research engineer with a solid cross-platform software development background. Throughout my career, I worked with 2D and 3D Graphics, various Cloud Solutions, and application development in financial, medical and gaming domains. A profound understanding of Cloud Computing, CI/CD, DevOps, DevSecOps, ML Ops, and Agile practices help me to build solid and standalone systems.

My interests lie in 3D, Parallel Algorithms, Computational Geometry, Computer Graphics, High-Performance Computing, Mathematics, Operating Systems, Physics, Programming Languages, Quantum Computing, Ray-Tracing, Robotics, Simulation, Software Development Practices, Space, and Visualization.
