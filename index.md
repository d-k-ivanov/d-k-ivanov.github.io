## About Me

I'm an energetic, hard-working, and result-oriented software engineer with a solid cross-platform Software Development, Computational Geometry, Scientific Visualization, DevOps, and Test Automation backgrounds.

Besides my work, I spend my time learning something new about software development, computer graphics and different visualization technologies, GPU programming, game development, robotics, embedded systems, space, physics, and mathematics.
